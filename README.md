Project Topic: Research The Cyber Kill Chain Model And The MITRE Matrix

Background: The Cyber Kill Chain is a process that is used in many cyber attacks. It starts with reconnaissance, where the attacker gathers information about the target. This is followed by weaponization, where the attacker prepares the attack tool or payload. The next step is delivery, where the attack is delivered to the target. The final stage is exploitation, where the attacker takes advantage of a vulnerability to gain access to the target's systems. This process can be used to target individuals, organizations, or governments. The Mitre ATT&CK Framework is used to help organizations understand the various techniques adversaries use to attack their systems. The framework provides a common language and structure for discussing attacks, and can be used to help identify potential gaps in an organization's defenses.


Exercise: Create a google document that comprehensively covers attack techniques defined by the Cyber kill chain model and the MITRE Matrix.


Specification:

For each of the attack techniques listed, provide the following information:

A concise definition for the technique, explaining its purpose and how it is typically employed by adversaries.
A list of penetration testing tools that can be utilized to test the technique.
Example of custom software tools used by attackers for the technique from the MITRE website (https://attack.mitre.org/software/).
